CVE-2018-10933 Vulnerability

With this project here we can use the main.py script to find out if any server is vulnerable to CVE-2018-10933, as an example I have provided you with a local server.py

Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up the project.

Prerequisites
Make sure to install a version of libssh between 0.7.6 and 0.8.4.
Generating the Keys
The project requires RSA and DSA keys. Use the following commands to generate them:

Generate RSA Key:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /path/to/your/rsakey.key

Generate DSA Key:
ssh-keygen -t dsa -f /path/to/your/dsakey.key

Compiling and Running the Server
Compile the server code using GCC:
gcc server.c -o server -lssh

Run the server:
./server

Running the Main Script
Once the server is running, you can execute the main Python script:
python3 main.py 0.0.0.0 -p 22 -t

Make sure to replace 0.0.0.0, 22, and -t with appropriate values based on your configuration.
