# CVE-2020-14145

## Auto-Add Policy Vulnerability - SSH

### Concept
This security attack exploits the CVE-2018-7750 vulnerability in Paramiko, a Python library for SSH connections. The vulnerability occurs due to a flawed implementation of SSH authentication in Paramiko. The attack allows an attacker to attack the SSH server and make it unreachable, 
by sending a large number of incorrect authentication attempts.

### Preparation
Create 3 VMs (any operating system, Kali Linux is recommended). 
You have to switch the network adapter of the VMs to a common LAN segment.

Execute these commands on every VM:
```
pip install paramiko
ip a
```

You have to find out which Network Interface corresponds to the LAN segment.
If it is "eth0" you can copy the following commands. Else you would have to substitute "eth0" with the corresponding Network interface.

+ on the "Attacker VM":
```
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.2/24 dev eth0
```
+ on the  "Client VM":
```
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.3/24 dev eth0
```
+ on the "Server VM":
```
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.4/24 dev eth0
```


### Exploit
Execute the following commands

+ on the "Server VM":
```
python3 server.py
```

+ on the "Attacker VM":
```
python3 dos_exploit.py
```

+ on the  "Client VM":
```
python3 client.py
```

### Result
It should no longer be possible to connect from the  "Client VM" to the "Server VM".
